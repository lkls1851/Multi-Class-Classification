# Multi-Class-Classification

1. Final.ipynb : Nodebook for code implementation and ROC-AUC values

In this problem, I tried Transfer learning model of Densenet 161 and built a classifier head on top of it.
For experiment, I also tried a deep neural network and a shallow neural network.

However, performance of transfer learning model is only a bit better than other two.

The trained model weights are uploaded: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1IvITzcTwBh_MmytHZWx77sBMBH1r8DPe/view?usp=sharing

AUC for class 0: 0.49320768000000004
AUC for class 1: 0.49742959999999997
AUC for class 2: 0.49865472
